# CyberGuardAI
This project focuses on building an NLP model for classifying crime descriptions into specific categories. The project was developed as part of a hackathon challenge to automate crime classification based on text inputs. The model aims to assist law enforcement agencies by categorizing complaints to streamline reporting, analysis, and response.
