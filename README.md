# Crime Category Prediction Using NLP

## Description
This project focuses on building an NLP model for classifying crime descriptions into specific categories. The project was developed as part of a hackathon challenge to automate crime classification based on text inputs. The model aims to assist law enforcement agencies by categorizing complaints to streamline reporting, analysis, and response.

## Features
- **Text Classification**: Classifies crime descriptions into predefined categories.
- **Web Interface**: A simple and user-friendly Flask-based web interface allows users to input text descriptions and receive categorized predictions.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and classification algorithms for high-accuracy predictions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and stemming are applied to clean and prepare text for model training.

## Motivation
With the rise in cyber and physical crimes, quick and accurate classification of crime reports can support authorities in taking prompt action. Automating this process also minimizes manual sorting errors and improves resource allocation.

## Methods and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: scikit-learn, joblib, pandas, nltk
- **Web Framework**: Flask for the web interface
- **Dataset**: A dataset with crime descriptions, categories, and subcategories used for training and testing the model

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VibhavariSutar/CyberGuardAI.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CyberGuardAI
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Run the Flask app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
Access the application at http://127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser.
## Usage
- Input a crime description into the provided text box in the web UI.
- Click "Predict" to view the crime category output generated by the model.

## Files Included
- **app.py**: The main application script for the Flask web interface.
- **crime_model.pkl**: Pre-trained classification model.
- **vectorizer.pkl**: Trained TF-IDF vectorizer for text preprocessing.
- **templates/**: HTML files for the web UI.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all dependencies for this project.
- **test.csv**: Test data file containing crime descriptions, categories, and additional information.
- **README.md**: Project overview and setup instructions.

## Future Improvements
- Expand the model to handle additional crime categories.
- Integrate a more advanced NLP model for improved classification accuracy.
- Enhance the user interface with additional functionality, such as batch processing of multiple records.
